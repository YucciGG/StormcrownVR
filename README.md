## Introduction to Stormcrown VR
Stormcrown VR is a modlist for Skyrim VR, curated with three primary objectives in mind: Variety, Immersion, and Customization.

### Key Features:
- **Variety:** Enhancing the base game with seasonal changes, completely remade locations like Falkreath, Winterhold, Morthal, and Dawnstar, and seamlessly integrated new weapons and armors. The focus is on balancing these additions to ensure a cohesive experience.
  
- **Immersion:** Prioritizing VR-friendly mods that enhance immersion by allowing interactions with in-game objects. An example of a non VR-friendly mod would be a city mod that adds a bunch of static food and cups on a table for example. In Stormcrown I want the world to be interactive. If I see a cup on a table, I should be able to pick it up.
  
- **Customizability:** The modlist is designed to be easily customizable. Don't like a particular mod? Disable it. Have a suggestion for an addition? Feel free to recommend it for consideration.

## Notable Mods

- [Seasons Of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861)﻿: Witness summer in the rift, winter in Whiterun, and winter in Falkreath 
- [Cities of the North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731): Falkreath, Winterhold, Morthal and Dawnstar have all been redesigned so every major city finally has a unique look
- [Experience & Statick Skill Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751): Gain levels by completing quests and exploring. Skills don't contribute to character's level anymore! And now you have full control over which skills to level up, a total overhaul to the vanilla formula
- [Ryn's Overhauls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/81880043?tab=user+files): Many familiar areas such as Ustengrav, Saarthal, Karthspire and every standing stone have been faithfully overhauled to give these areas a breath of fresh air. The focus was to give Main Quest areas a new look, but it touches many other areas as well
- [Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100985?tab=description)﻿: Sentinel adds a ton of variety to weapons and armor without affecting the balance of the game
- [Simonrim's gameplay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files&BH=2)﻿: A large overhaul of almost every part of the game that offers better balance, progression and fun
- [Traverse the Ulvenwald](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57874)﻿: A huge tree overhaul that adds some much needed variety to the Trees of Skyrim and Soltheim. Integrated seasons support!
- [Project ja-Kha'jay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57610)﻿: Adds the Khajiit races from Oblivion and Morrowind as well as ESO and gives Khajiit some actual variety. They finally have some visual variety!
- [Dynamic Animal Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72978)﻿: Tired of seeing the same gray wolves? The same white chickens? This mod adds variation to animals by giving them randomized appearances. Different wolves will have different colored fur for example. 

The modlist aims to strike a balance between challenge and accessibility, offering a rewarding experience without resorting to excessive hand-holding or hardcore difficulty.

## Requirements

Whilst Stormcrown VR includes a visual overhaul it's higly customizable meaning the performance requirement varies. For reference, here's my my specs

#### Here are my specs: 
- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti
- CPU: Ryzen 9 5950x
- RAM: 32GB 3600mhz
- SSD: M.2 NVMe drive

Now while this is a pretty high end computer, this list is designed to be ran on weaker systems as well. I don't have a minimum specs section because it would be hard to calculate that without any data. If you try the list, please report any performance issues!
