## Introduction to Stormcrown VR
Stormcrown VR is a modlist for Skyrim VR, curated with three primary objectives in mind: Variety, Immersion, and Customization.

### Key Features:
- **Variety:** Enhancing the base game with seasonal changes, completely remade locations like Falkreath, Winterhold, Morthal, and Dawnstar, and seamlessly integrated new weapons and armors. The focus is on balancing these additions to ensure a cohesive experience.
  
- **Immersion:** Prioritizing VR-friendly mods that enhance immersion by allowing interactions with in-game objects. An example of a non VR-friendly mod would be a city mod that adds a bunch of static food and cups on a table for example. In Stormcrown I want the world to be interactive. If I see a cup on a table, I should be able to pick it up.
  
- **Customizability:** Offering flexibility with two pre-configured profiles: ENB and Community Shaders. Additionally, the modlist is designed to be easily customizable. Don't like a particular mod? Disable it. Have a suggestion for an addition? Feel free to recommend it for consideration.

## Gameplay Overhaul
Stormcrown VR goes beyond mere visual enhancements, fundamentally altering the way you experience Skyrim. The gameplay has been carefully restructured to emphasize balance and player agency.

### Skill Progression:
- The way you level up and gain experience has been completely overhauled. In Vanilla Skyrim, once you leveled up a skill it would contribute to your actual player level. This could become quite repetetive and cheesy. In Stormcrown, Skills and the way you gain experience has been completely reworked. To level up skills, you will now need to level up your character first. 
  
-For each level, you gain a certain amount of skill points which you can use to level up your skills. This is much more balanced and fun as you're now more in control of how your character progresses. 
  
- Experience points are now earned through exploration and dungeon clearing, providing another reason to actually explore.

### Enhanced RPG Elements:
- Various gameplay tweaks enhance the RPG elements of Skyrim. For instance, potions now heal over time, discouraging spamming while retaining their potency. This change contributes to a more strategic approach to combat and resource management.
  
- The modlist aims to strike a balance between challenge and accessibility, offering a rewarding experience without resorting to excessive hand-holding or hardcore difficulty.
